<li><strong>No spamming or botting.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Profanity and swearing are allowed.</strong> Just don’t overdo it.</li>
<li><strong>Use brackets for out-of-character chat in in-character areas (e.g., #ic-comms, #space-rp and SB server hubs). Like this:</strong>(( This is OOC chat. ))</li>
<li><strong>Keep in-character shitposting to a minimum.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keep out-of-character chat to a minimum in in-character areas.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Playing the rules game, making frivolous reports to staff and other abusive behaviour are not tolerated.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If staff say there’s an issue, there’s an issue. Don’t play games over this.</strong></li>
<li>Try to use good spelling and grammar on the Discord and server. In-character affectations, such as accents, lisps and writing styles, are perfectly fine and even encouraged, as long as they aren’t intentionally obnoxious in an out-of-character manner.</li>
<li>It is recommended that you use SI/metric units here. Imperial/customary measurements (e.g., feet, inches, pounds) in roleplay sheets will be converted to metric by staff.</li>

<h1>Roleplay rules<a class="headerlink" href="#roleplay-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Read these before roleplaying on Epsilon RP. <em>IC</em> stands for <em>in-character</em> and <em>OOC</em> stands for <em>out-of-character</em>. <em>ERP</em> stands for <em>erotic roleplay</em> and <em>CRP</em> stands for <em>combat roleplay</em>.</p>
<p>### Definitions</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>RP:</strong> Roleplay.</li>
<li><strong>Combat roleplay (CRP):</strong> Roleplay in which a character attempts to fight another character or defend against a fight. Attempts to harm a character without engaging in combat do not count, though they do count for consent purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Erotic roleplay (ERP):</strong> Roleplay in which a character performs actions that are sexual or erotic in nature. <em>Romantic roleplay</em> does not always fall under this term.</li>
<li><strong>In character (IC):</strong> Whenever you are roleplaying as a character. This includes actions taken by characters or stuff happening in the background.</li>
<li><strong>Out of character (OOC):</strong> Whenever you are not roleplaying as any character. This includes any chat directly to other roleplayers outside of roleplay itself.</li>
<li><strong>Metagaming:</strong> Any use of out-of-character knowledge in an in-character manner. Examples of this include “reading minds” when your character is not telepathic, acting as if your character knows anything they wouldn’t know under the circumstances, and spite RP (defined below).</li>
<li><strong>Godmodding:</strong> Roleplay in which one character forces actions on another without OOC consent or against OOC refusal or in which a character swoops in and does everything with the snap of a finger, or similar roleplay.</li>
<li><strong>Powergaming:</strong> Roleplay involving any abilities, weapons or other items not listed on a combat sheet, if they don’t fall under the exceptions list, or involving <em>twinking</em>, defined below. This typically merits a discussion with staff and character balancing. This is not to be confused with <em>godmodding</em>, defined above.</li>
<li><strong>Twinking:</strong> Roleplay involving grossly overpowered characters with few or no weaknesses. Such characters are called <em>twinks</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Munchkin:</strong> A roleplayer who engages in CRP to win rather than to have fun, tell stories and interact with other characters.</li>
<li><strong>Spite RP:</strong> Adjusting a character’s behaviour or actions based on OOC relationships and vendettas. Sometimes, spite RP goes to the point of outright harassment.</li>
<li><strong>Forced RP:</strong> Abuse or bending of the rules in order to force an RP action on someone else’s character.</li>
<li><strong>Non-player character (NPC):</strong> Any character not directly RPed by any player.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-clienting:</strong> Connecting to the server with multiple SB clients to be able to RP multiple characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>### Important stuff</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>*Use common sense.*</strong> There’s no telling how many problems could be resolved or avoided by following this one simple rule.</li>
<li><strong>If a staff member tells you there’s a problem, there’s a problem. Do not ignore staff just because your violation is not explicitly listed or referenced in the rules.</strong> Staff will try to work with you to correct the problem without resorting to staff action.</li>
<li><strong>Ignorance is no excuse or “get out of jail free” card. Please read the rules.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forced RP or other abuse or manipulation of the rules to one’s own benefit (e.g., harassing a roleplayer into death consent) will lead to staff action. Don’t play the rules game.</strong> Victims of forced RP or rule abuse should immediately privately report it to the staff via Discord DMs.</li>
<li><strong>Powergaming, godmodding and metagaming are NOT allowed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Original characters please. References to other franchises are fine, but they are generally fictional in the in-character universe.</strong> If you want to roleplay an existing franchise character, staff permission <em>and</em> an ironclad IC justification are required.</li>
<li><strong>Staff permission is required to roleplay certain important lore characters, e.g., Clipped Council members.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Magic and psionics are NOT allowed.</strong> All character abilities and items should have some sort of reasonably realistic explanation behind them (within the realm of hard sci-fi). If you intend to roleplay existing characters with magical or psionic abilities, either retcon out the abilities or don’t play the characters at all.</li>
<li><strong>Character abilities, equipment and resources should be ICly justified and preferably balanced, with sensible weaknesses.</strong> Don’t just make a billionaire character willy-nilly. Roleplayers who make overpowered or “gamey” characters will have a chat with staff first.</li>
<li><strong>If you are violating rules, staff may require your character to “take an L”, force CRP consent, allow others to void you without consequence or permakill your character, etc., depending on the severity of the violation. If violations are bad enough, you may be banned from RP. Rule violations done out of OOC spite will receive more stringent punishment.</strong> IC explanation for punishment consequences is generally left to the punished roleplayer, if staff do not provide it.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>General rules<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>All roleplayers MUST be mature. However, underage/immature *characters* are permitted. You must be 18+ to see NSFW content though.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Metagaming, powergaming and godmodding are not allowed.</strong> Please report such incidents to staff or RP monitors.</li>
<li><strong>ERP is *NOT ALLOWED* on the server, in the wiki, or in the RP channels.</strong> If you want to ERP, do it in Discord DMs.</li>
<li><strong>Underage ERP, regardless of whether it’s the roleplayers or characters, or both, that are underage, *even if implied*, will be *swiftly and immediately met with a permanent ban*. No excuses or appeals.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keep ERP to private Discord DMs. Public ERP on the server *á la maniére de Stallion* will be met with a swift ban, and private ERP on the server will lead to staff action.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keep OOC chat to a minimum on roleplay hubs and IC channels.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Avoid IC references to OOC pop culture and memes unless it makes sense for your character to make such references.</strong> After all, it’s ICly the year 3219.</li>
<li><strong>This is a serious roleplay community. Avoid shitpost/joke characters and gamey fourth-wall-breaking RP. Excessive or obnoxious fourth-wall breaking or overuse of shitpost/joke characters may lead to restrictions from roleplay.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Please refrain from excessive and gratuitous IC insults or disparagement if OOCly requested.</strong> Not everyone can handle this stuff or keep OOC and IC emotions separated. Consistent and callous disregard for or insensitivity to such OOC requests will lead to staff action.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-server roleplay is encouraged!</strong> Bring in all the existing characters you want.</li>
<li><strong>Server lore takes precedence over vanilla lore on Epsilon RP.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Roleplayers should try to resolve conflicts regarding roleplay rules before going to staff.</strong> This should hopefully save everyone a lot of grief.</li>
<li>Some combat-related rules may be ignored if consent from all parties is given <em>and</em> staff give the okay to it. Abuse of this stipulation is, however, not tolerated.</li>
<li><em>In-game day/night cycles and weather are to be taken as in-roleplay conditions</em> (they have been modified on the server to be more realistic).</li>

You may post sheets on Discord in the <cite>SHEETS AND LORE</cite> channels (the latter option is recommended for newcomers). Character sheets should come with a picture of the associated character. Sheets/pages and approval are <strong>always</strong> required whenever staff say so, and staff may rework sheets and pages if they see issues with them.

</div>
<div class="section" id="consent-rules">
<h2>Consent rules<a class="headerlink" href="#consent-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section explains the rules dealing with consent to harming other characters.</p>
<p>### Definitions</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Consent:</strong> Expressly or implicitly given OOC permission to roleplay a permanent, impactful or long-lasting IC action (e.g., maiming or death) towards another roleplayer’s character or characters.</li>
<li><strong>Consent refusal:</strong> Express or implicit OOC refusal of permission for the above.</li>
<li><strong>Encounter:</strong> Any situation in which there is a fight or any attempt to harm a character.</li>
<li><strong>Death:</strong> Any state in which is a character is <em>dead</em> and unable to come back <em>at all</em>. Reviving dead characters <em>requires</em> staff approval, which is highly unlikely to be given.</li>
<li><strong>KO:</strong> Knock-out. Any state in which a character is unable to be RPed at all for a while (at least 24 hours) due to being comatose, highly drugged, in a stupor or in a similar state. Shorter periods of time in such a state are considered to be incap. Death of a synthetic/robotic character typically counts as a KO, unless all backups are destroyed.</li>
<li><strong>Incapacitation (incap):</strong> Any state in which a character is ICly unable to engage in a combat encounter in any real capacity for at least 24 hours (usually due to severe traumatic injuries) and may be unable to be RPed for up to 24 hours, but may otherwise be roleplayed (though is likely stuck in an ICU or similar until they recover). Such a character is incapacitated, or ‘’incapped’ for short.</li>
<li><strong>Maiming:</strong> Any injury that a character cannot easily recover from, even with medical care (e.g. loss of a limb or important ability).</li>
<li><strong>Instigation:</strong> Provoking another character (via insults, name-calling, etc.) into starting a fight or otherwise attempting to injure, maim, incap or kill you.</li>
<li><strong>Aggression:</strong> Attempting to start a fight with another character. This is different from instigation in that <em>your character themselves</em>, the <em>aggressor</em>, is starting the fight.</li>
<li><strong>Injury:</strong> Any state in which a character is injured, maimed or loses abilities in CRP that cause them to be at a disadvantage in subsequent encounters until healed.</li>
<li><strong>Implicit consent:</strong> Consent given <em>implicitly</em> by roleplaying as if an action requiring consent succeeded.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit consent:</strong> Consent given directly by outright telling the other party or parties that it is given.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-consent:</strong> Automatic consent. This may be applied as a punishment for RP rule violations, or may optionally be enforced on oneself.</li>
</ul>
<p>### How consent works</p>
<p><strong>Consent is normally *required* to harm another roleplayer’s character. Abuse of the consent system will result in staff voids and/or restrictions from roleplay.</strong> Here is how the consent system works:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>If your character did not instigate or otherwise start the fight</em>, you have the full right to consent against death, KO, incap, maiming and even injury, <em>unless</em> your character falls under any exceptions below.</li>
<li><em>If your character instigated the encounter but isn’t the aggressor</em>, you lose consent against injury for that encounter.</li>
<li><em>If your character is the aggressor in the encounter</em>, you lose consent against incap for that encounter.</li>
<li><em>If your character attempts to maim another character (regardless of success)</em>, you lose consent against maiming for that encounter.</li>
<li><em>If your character attempts to KO or kill another character (regardless of success)</em>, you lose consent against KO for that encounter.</li>
<li><em>If your character has killed, KOed or maimed multiple other characters</em> (as decided by staff, but most cases are obvious), your character may lose consent against KO <em>indefinitely</em>.</li>
<li><em>Any insta-kill attempt</em> (i.e., any attack that unavoidably leads to a character’s death) requires full death consent.</li>
<li><em>Consent against death can only ever be lost in cases of severe rule violations.</em> In all other cases, it is fully voluntary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lack of consent means that an attempt to injure, maim, incap, KO or kill a character failed; the person who RPed the attempt is responsible for explaining the failure if staff don’t supply an explanation.</p>
<p>You may revoke consent as long as the action consented to hasn’t already been RPed out and you haven’t lost it due to the above rules. You’re allowed to have auto-consenting characters; it’s recommended to list what your character auto-consents to on their sheet. You can also have characters that automatically <em>refuse</em> consent, but only if they strictly do not participate in CRP at all. (However, characters that automatically refuse <em>death consent</em> can participate in CRP as much as they want.)</p>
<p>Staff can apply automatic consent to any or all of your characters as punishment for rule violations; e.g., your characters may be required to consent to incap, KO or even death as punishment for repeated munchkin behaviour. Staff may also override consent rules for events and other reasons; e.g., characters that KO or kill multiple characters during an event may be allowed to keep consent against KO and not have the KOs and deaths count against them.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike ILB, there is no such thing as “CRP consent” on Epsilon RP.</p>
<p>### Consent for special abilities</p>
<p>Separate consent is <em>required</em> for any staff-approved character ability marked as requiring such from targets. This is <em>separate</em> from regular consent. This kind of consent is automatically given if the target RPs that his character has been affected by the ability in question, so there’s no need to give it explicitly. Revocation rules for this kind of consent are the same as for regular consent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voiding-and-retconning-rp">
<h2>Voiding and retconning RP<a class="headerlink" href="#voiding-and-retconning-rp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Voiding:</strong> Rescinding an RP plot, situation or encounter and RPing as if it never happened.</li>
<li><strong>Retconning:</strong> Altering a past RP plot, situation and encounter, usually with an attempt to avoid plot holes that might result from a void, and RPing as if it happened that way.</li>
<li><strong>Staff-voiding:</strong> Voiding by staff.</li>
<li><strong>Staff-retconning:</strong> Retconning by staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may void or retcon any RP situation, as long as you’re not doing it to avoid IC consequences (or OOC punishments applied to characters), <em>and</em> all RPers (excluding those with invalidated votes) involved in the RP or staff not involved in the RP agree to the void or retcon. Retconning is generally preferred over voiding for obvious reasons – outright voiding creates plot holes that need to be resolved. If for any reason you want or need to void or retcon IC consequences, or wish to appeal an OOC punishment, talk to staff.</p>
<p><em>If an RPer refuses to void or retcon an RP out of OOC spite or with the intention to OOCly force RP on you</em>, discuss it with staff. Such force-RPers will have disciplinary action taken against them; this usually includes staff-voiding or -retconning the RP and may even include invalidating the force-RPer’s future void/retcon votes so it doesn’t happen again.</p>
<p>Staff may decide to staff-void or staff-retcon RP, usually to remove a permabanned RPer’s IC actions from lore; staff will notify anyone involved in the RP of the void or retcon and why it needed to be voided or retconned, and will try to work out an agreement with involved RPers. RP involving a character’s death, as defined by consent rules, needs staff permission to void.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="character-revival">
<h2>Character revival<a class="headerlink" href="#character-revival" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You must apply with staff to revive dead characters (as defined above in the consent section) in any way. Character revival is highly unlikely, and staff will almost always enforce temporary or permanent disadvantages, disabilities or other effects on revived characters depending on the method and circumstances of revival.</p>
<p>### Revival application template</p>
<p>When submitting revival applications, use the following template:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Which character are you requesting revival for?</li>
<li>How is your character being brought back? (Include whether or not it is another player character, an event, or a self-revival via background methods; this includes being dragged to a cloning vat or neural scanner by allies or cronies.)</li>
<li>How long has your character been dead? How much damage has there been to the body, and especially to the brain or equivalent?</li>
<li>How was your character killed, and who or what killed them?</li>
<li>Is your character of a common race or an uncommon race? Which race is it?</li>
<li>Do your character’s race or traits make revival/cloning/uploading difficult?</li>
<li>Has your character been revived previously? (Please include <strong>all</strong> instances of revival/cloning/uploading that affect the version of your character seen on-server, including off-server background.)</li>
<li>What were the circumstances of their most recent death?</li>
<li>Do you consent to staff-decided penalties and side effects from cloning/revival?</li>
<li>If “yes” to the above, do you have any suggestions? (This is to provide staff with an idea of what you want; there’s no guarantee that this will affect the final result.)</li>
</ul>
<p>### Reviving KOed characters</p>
<p>Reviving a <em>KOed</em> character does not require staff permission, but there will be staff action if a KOed character is revived within an unreasonably short period of time when injuries are taken into consideration (usually less than 48 hours). You’re responsible for handling KOs reasonably.</p>

<div class="section" id="multi-clienting-reinforcements-and-npc-characters">
<h2>Multi-clienting, reinforcements and NPC characters<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-clienting-reinforcements-and-npc-characters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>### Multi-clienting</p>
<p>Multi-clienting requires either explicit consent from everyone involved, or staff approval. Abuse of multi-clienting will result in staff action. Please keep it reasonable, folks! You may void unconsented multi-clienting at any time without consequence. The voided multi-clienter is responsible for IC explanation of voids and retcons, if one is not provided by staff.</p>
<p>### NPC characters</p>
<p><em>NPC characters</em> may be used for non-combat stuff like menial labour, clerical work or scientific research, but again, please keep it reasonable! Staff approval is required for non-combatant NPC characters that have unusual abilities or equipment, such as Miniknog mind transfer tech. Powergaming, metagaming and godmodding rules will be strictly enforced whenever NPC characters with unusual abilities or equipment are involved.</p>
<p><em>NPC combatants</em> are allowed in restricted situations if permission is given by staff, but any other use of NPC combatants is strictly <em>not</em> allowed. Staff reserve discretion in this matter – consult staff about NPC combatants if you intend to use them. Any powergaming, metagaming, forced RP or other abuse of NPC combatants will result in denial or revocation of NPC combat permission. Feel free to report any abuse of NPCs you see to staff. The OOC controller of the combatants is responsible for IC explanation of voids and retcons, if one is not provided by staff.</p>
<p>### Combat reinforcements</p>
<p>Reinforcements need to be called in <em>ICly</em> and usually take several turns to arrive (at least two), depending on the distance they need to travel. If there is no IC way to call in reinforcements or it is being blocked (e.g., a phone is knocked out of one’s hand or there’s an EMP), reinforcements cannot be called in until that is addressed (e.g., by picking up the radio or waiting until the EMP expires and using equipment that’s not fried). Characters called as reinforcements <em>must</em> either have only civilian equipment or have a combat sheet already existing at the time reinforcements are called. Otherwise, only <em>non-combat</em> characters with basic equipment can be called in. Creating reinforcement character sheets “on demand” is powergaming/twinking and therefore not allowed, and NPCs <em>cannot</em> be called in as reinforcements without staff permission; staff action, which may include prohibiting characters from calling in reinforcements, will be taken if these rules are violated.</p>

<div class="section" id="buildings-and-claims">
<h2>Buildings and claims<a class="headerlink" href="#buildings-and-claims" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Buildings, claims and plots may NOT be ICly attacked or destroyed without the consent of their OOC owner (or the OOC hub owner, or staff, if no owner is listed). Character backups may be destroyed without consent, unless consent is required to enter and destroy the building they are located in.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="combat-and-ability-rules-and-guidelines">
<h2>Combat and ability rules and guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#combat-and-ability-rules-and-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Try to roleplay combat and abilities sensibly.</em> The most important rule of all in this section.</li>
<li><em>No ship combat in planetary atmospheres or within 100 km (ICly) of hubs or planetary surfaces.</em> By the way, space RP is generally done in <cite>#space</cite> on the Discord server, not on the SB server, although you may RP radio transmissions from space and effects on planetary surfaces below on the SB server.</li>
<li><em>Mechs and mechsuits</em> require special ability consent (as listed above) to use.</li>
<li><em>Ships, mechs and mechsuits should require six to eight turns to summon and two or three turns to get in when in CRP.</em> Hoverbikes, motorbikes and the like should require one or two turns to get in.</li>
<li><em>Mind your weapon drawing and reloading.</em> Unless you have very fast reflexes, you cannot draw a two-handed gun and fire it in the same turn. Firing a handgun as you draw it results in poor accuracy. It takes one or two turns to reload a gun. It takes two or three turns to draw a bow before releasing an arrow, or it won’t get very far. You usually need a whole turn to draw a sword (but a knife can be used in the same turn it’s drawn, usually). As far as drawing other weapons goes, balance them sensibly.</li>
<li><em>Disguises and makeup</em> are allowed without consent, but <em>surgery, DNA modification and detailed shapeshifting</em> require consent from the RPer whose character is used as the disguise. (No consent is required if the disguise character is RPed or was created by the same RPer, obviously.)</li>
</ul>
